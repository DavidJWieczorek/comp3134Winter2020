1. The script queries an exact value and returns all the column values for that row.
   
2. The query returns the values as though the names were passed normally. The extra characters didnt effect the search at all. 
   There was no difference from the first point since the single quote closed the query string and ignored the rest.

3. My expectation was that the query would return all the rows in the table. However, this was not the case since I have single quotes 
   around the varible inside the php script.
